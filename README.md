# Team13

Official repository for the Inter IIT Tech aerial robotics PS Team 13

### Repository Contents:

- **python_wrapper: Task 1**
   - *Description:* Platform-independent and User-friendly Python API to communicate with the drone developed by transforming the ROS-based communication architecture

- **vision_based_PID: Task 2**
   - *Description:* Within this directory, you'll find implementations related to a vision-based Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller. It includes algorithms and utilities tailored for vision-based control systems, enabling precise control by leveraging visual feedback.

- **vision_based_swarming: Task 3**
   - *Description:* This directory contains code and resources for vision-based swarming algorithms. It encompasses techniques and algorithms that enable multiple agents or entities to coordinate and navigate collectively using visual information.
 
- **collected_data_and_plotting: post-flight analytics dashboard**
   - *Description:* The data from every experiment was collected, and a post-flight analytics dashboard was created using Plotly. This facilitated the controller tuning process and identification of any unusual behavior in the drone.
