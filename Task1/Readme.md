# Task 1 Submission
## Problem Statement for task 1

The first task required us to develop a python Wrapper for the Drone Pluto 1.2 using MSP packets and socket communication to control the basic movements of the drone (Arm, Take-off, Land, Throttle, Roll, Pitch, Yaw, etc). Our python wrapper is capable of running on both Windows and Linux machines and relies on simple python socket communication. 
In order to execute the wrapper, connect to the drone's wifi and navigate to the Task 1 folder to run the PlutoArm.py file.
